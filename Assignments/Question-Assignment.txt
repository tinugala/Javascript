1. Write a program to create a Mathematical calculation table from 0 to given number n.
2. Write a program to find the square of given number from 0 to n.
3. 1. Create a basic calculator program using Javascript
   2. Use different arithmetic operators and variables to show working of calculator 
4. Given `n` pieces of sweet, help Peter and John divide it among themselves such that both get an equal number of sweets. Note that the sweet can not be broken into sub-pieces. You have to tell if it is possible to make such distribution or not based upon n number of pieces. I.e., possible outputs: `yes` or `no.`
   Example-1 Input: 8 Output: Yes
   Example-2 Input: 7 Output: No
5. Given the length of three line segments as a, b, and c., Find if they can form a triangle or not? (Students are not expected to take any user input, solve the problem using hardcoded value)
   Example-1 Input: a=7,b=10,c=5 Output: triangle 

6. Write a function that takes two numbers x and y and calculates x^y
7. Write a function that takes two parameters num and k and returns the value of Binomial Coefficient
C(num, k)
Sample input: num = 6, k = 3
Sample output: 20
