1996. The Number of Weak Characters in the Game


You are playing a game that contains multiple characters, and each of the characters has two main properties: attack and defense. You are given a 2D integer array properties where properties[i] = [attack i, defense i] represents the properties of the ith character in the game.

A character is said to be weak if any other character has both attack and defense levels strictly greater than this character's attack and defense levels. More formally, a character i is said to be weak if there exists another character j where attack j > attack i and defense j > defense i.

Return the number of weak characters.

var numberOfWeakCharacters = function(properties) {
    properties.sort((a,b) => (a[0] == b[0]) ? (a[1]-b[1]) : (b[0]-a[0]))
    let count = 0, max = 0
    for(let arr of properties){
        if(arr[1] < max)    count++
        max = Math.max(max, arr[1])
    }
    return count
};
